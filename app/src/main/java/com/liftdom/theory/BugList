CURRENT BUG LIST:

(Constant WIP throughout) Various crashes

* WorkoutAssistor adds frag "Heal up! Today is a rest day." when it's not a rest day.
**DONE** Rotate change adds frags in various places
**DONE** Editing and creating templates adds extra set schemes
**DONE** Set Schemes need to be added by top->down priority

error on create account without inputting information (null check)
pages where there aren't values, show that there aren't values..
nav drawer check
more null checking if user doesn't click something
if exercise is a bodyweight exercise, have option to replace with bodyweight.
"Add day" people may think it literally means add that day to schedule
give option to make active template (maybe default active for new users)
on back press causing template deletion.
    * happens when going back to "save template as..."
    * only happens after advancing one frag/activity forward and then back
add color ish notifications for adding and deleting so people can see
adding a shit ton of exercises and set-schemes results in weird shit
