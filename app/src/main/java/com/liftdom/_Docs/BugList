Longer custom ex names
Newest creates custom ex listed first (and used?)
Custom ex names should have uppercase first.

----------------------
====================================================

============ CURRENTLY WORKING ON (FOR v1.40) ===================================
----- Service -----
Notification should have set numbers (1/3) etc
WA: notification bar should check for last one you were on when you deactivate it
WA: rest times in notification bar
Service gets fucked up when WA/running assistor changes

----- WA -----
possibly add added exercises to workout (from WA to template)
possibly only update LAYOUT on screen changes (onResume), keep updating DATABASE as it is.
shouldn't lose place in notification when WA detects changes.
WA/service need to somehow be asynced. It's too laggy.
assistor service class arrayindexoutofboundsexception after changing stuff (weights) and assistor
    resetting
update WA when closing keyboard (to handle changing s/r/w info and saving it)
Wa new sets should be sets dialog first
Hide button for exercises to reduce clutter in WA
Weight edit text WA not defaulting zero to blank
Need to handle changing template mid workout (maybe check running assistor against new template save
 status of checked ones.)
Rounding option for percentages (nearest 5 or nearest to up)

----- Template Editor -----
allow rep/weight settings to be changed for all sets of an exercise in template editor. prob in WA too.
Switching apps back and forth fucks up the template editor.
if percentage, actionNext for weight edit text, remember max/format for each new set? especially if
    you did the full set percentage option for the whole exercise. also maybe make 1 the default sets?
decimal support for these percentages.
percentages need decimals.
duplicate template (template name dialog, save, go back to saved programs)

----- Charts/Stats/Tools -----
Weights of workouts should be charted, literally just chart the workouts, it's easier to see progress
Ex specific chart is essentially useless
exercise maxes list should have search
exercise maxes list should have option to change sort order
exercise maxes list should have option to set max manually (and say it was manual in each item)
need to be able to set maxes
Put workout chart/maxes first, then calculators
when a workout saves, save the name and show that when looking back at past workouts.
    - workout types need to be in completedWorkoutViewHolder/ModelClass (could add a string + \n)
    - also integrate into charts

----- Premades -----
Be able to edit the maxes of a premade
future constructor for premades
Auto populate maxes for w531fb (tm's, so 90% of maxes)
Add P/P/L Reddit
we need to check w531fb and smolov, that shit is fucked.
Premades need future workout calendar compat
Need to have some kind of end condition for premade programs.
Come up with a plan for missing weight in a workout.

----- Non-code Necessities -----
Talk to Firebase about the privacy rules
Revamp the intro to better take care of GDPR and clear up the email privacy stuff.
Rework Appodeal (+ better asking permission) or drop it

----- Difficult to Replicate -----
Revise workout looping, not working rest day do workout instead all have a problem being recognized (cannot replicate)
user profile got null (profileHeaderFrag 84)
=====================================================

============ ON DECK FOR v1.41+: ===============================================
expand notification to see full ex name and possibly see set information (ie, 1/3)
for offline, we could even save the current template to disk anytime you save a template, so it can
    - be inflated offline. and then save the WA to disk anytime you would update fb. have a warning
    text box flashing at them to hit the finish button when they are in service/wifi range.
save page/state of app for kill in background
make WA the default opener, make feed
hamburger needs back functionality
cheat prevention, have a cap for xp gain. maybe report system if numbers are too high
not logged in can be random node, just rewrite node to become user.
next workout info on rest day/workout finished frag
true chat functionality/workout reminders (check that Firebase support email){
    easy idea for seen/unseen chats. When a user sends a message, for everyone
    in the chat, their chat group gains the "unseen" tag. Any time a user is in
    the frag/firebase recycler gets updated, unseen tag is removed.
}
For premades, you should show a full calendar of the shit. maybe under the page you can just view it
supersetting in WA
rest timer
search for users? bring back discover page
user "flair"
focus dismiss after keyboard dismiss
Fix up the Exercise History Chart page. (simply show exercises' full stuff (like 3x5@95lbs))
add title callbacks for public programs/pre-made programs
show workout count in profile
max editing (* = set manually, not in liftdom workout)(also measurements)
increase edit text max lengths for weight values
decimal percentage functionality
Improve the notification-bar layout.
Add past update text to a dedicated page for that
Add these workout programs{
    Building the Monolith // no app for this
    GZCL
    Conjugate
    Stronger by Science 28 free bench/squat/dead programs.
    Westside for Skinny Bastards.
    PHAT and PHUL
    nSuns
    nSuns 531 LP
    StrongLifts 5x5
    Starting Strength
    GreySkull LP
    Push Pull Legs (Reddit)
    Lvysaurs 4-4-8
    Practical programming
    Madcow 5x5 Training Program
    Texas Method
}
=====================================================

============ BUG LIST =====================================================
==== easier ==========
============
==== harder ==========
(performance){
    (view holder) see if we need to change from multiple hidden views to one inserted view (use methods?)
    (recycler adapter) maybe do the operations currently in here in the assistor saved frag
}
Some algo concerns:
Main concern is about the days check. Doesn't seem to be any. It's working for now but that
    may be because hasRunThroughOnce is making sure we don't see the second copy.
    But what happens if we're on _Tuesday and we run through the other one first?
============

============ TO-DO FEATURE LIST =============================
better competitive stuff (login streaks, leaderboards, etc)
more monetization{
    look into the hiding of banner ads when switching frags to allow for multiple ads in same activity
    look at Zhuinden suggestion (setVisisbleHint? can't remember)
}
better old device support
frame publicity posts as looking for beta testers/early adopters
have the tutorials be made viewable by buttons
ask for good reviews, feedback if not good.
check here for more{
 https://medium.com/@lowcarbrob/0-to-15k-active-users-in-a-month-tips-from-a-indiedev-41d05ab048fd
}

===== lifting/core-related =========
fix up the view of post info in completed workout view holder
alert user if their percentage goes above 100%
implement some sort of "short term memory" type thing for when changing weight options in template editor
try this for notification-bar/lockscreen view difference {
    https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/
    Notification.Builder.html#setPublicVersion(android.app.Notification)
}
need to make kgs have decimal capability
more percentage work{
    Will just be doing arbitrary weight now.
    Need to have possibility of choosing from maxes (which I also need to expand on)
}
make StatChartsFrag not look like shit (different colors for ex's, stack vertically)
WA update on set addition
use .setPublicVersion to show different lockscreen service view
add share option for finished workout
more quotes in more places
add better running support
redo add-exercise flow in WA (set set-scheme + superset)
add feedback page (or just create chat with each user)
more programs {
    PPL
    5x5
    Starting Strength
    Mad Cow
    Texas Method
}
fill in the Knowledge Center (including ex descriptions in other packages)
Advanced calendar view template editor a la Google Calendar (repeat every other, etc)
======================

===== social/user-related ==========
Add third tab to profile slider (Stats (active template, streak, maxes, etc))
Forum
fix overflow icon (currently is always search bar)
Empty search show all users
Discover tab // or community tab, show highest rated posts from everyone{
    instead, could just add a default checkbox that adds your workout to the public pool.
    the main feed then just has a slider that also shows the global community
}
glide caching in chat (maybe just do it differently, load in parent, get from parent)
chat unread stuff/rehaul (including badge/notifications/unread functionality(bool hasRead))
forum
======================
=====================================================

============ UNREPLICABLE/UNDECIDED =============================================
maybe just have one user profile? (could really utilize methods/delegating here)
sign in text is cut off (API 21 issue)
bottom nav text is cut off (API 21 issue)
=====================================================

============ FUTURE TO-DO LIST =====================================================
change search suggestions to current following (visibility issue?)
password recovery/changing
look into design stuff like font
// be a real companion. personalize the shit...
    // tell them about eating and sleeping and stretching, foam rolling,etc
    // give them options for push notifications and reminders
=====================================================

======== RANDOM STUFF I WROTE DOWN =================================================
"Important steps for scaled success"
-------------------------------------
Fix up the chat, big time.
Public posts tab (posted via public-checkmark in WA)
Take a good look at completion/log-in streak. Need compulsive opening of Liftdom...
Main feed performance/visual rehaul
Scaling of power level needs to be looked at. We need faster leveling at the low levels probably.
Share completed workouts to Facebook/Twitter/Raw copy
Target niche workout programs/subreddits with good sized followings.
Need true running support (detect if running, then have good extra options for it)(simple - ___miles/yds or ___kms/ms)
Leaderboard tab in Assistor Saved (Global/Local)
CompletedWorkoutViewholder - if is the current day, display in minutes or hours ago.
