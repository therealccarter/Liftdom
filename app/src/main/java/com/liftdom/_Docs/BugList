===========================================
============ BUG/TO-DO LIST ====================================================
===========================================

======== ***Completed*** =======================================================
currently on v1.31
----------------------
layout work on BMI calc/cal calc
fixed notification layout crowding issue
fixed calorie calculator values
----------------------
====================================================

============ CURRENTLY WORKING ON: ===============================================
add maxes section to stats/charts/tools
add wilks section to stats/charts/tools
rehaul of exercise history chart{
    radio buttons here      reload button here (auto-reload on ex chose)
    one button that shows the exercise name/choose exercise
    one button under that says clear chart
}
add title callbacks for public programs/pre-made programs
check to see if user search shows all or if it's also limited to one. (like how the ex selector search was)
ad rehaul (add to the coordinator layout toolbar/have it hide when gone, show otherwise)
=====================================================

============ ON DECK FOR v1.32+: ===============================================
true chat functionality/workout reminders (check that Firebase support email){
    easy idea for seen/unseen chats. When a user sends a message, for everyone
    in the chat, their chat group gains the "unseen" tag. Any time a user is in
    the frag/firebase recycler gets updated, unseen tag is removed.
}
hamburger needs back functionality
focus dismiss after keyboard dismiss
Add these workout programs{
    Building the Monolith
    GZCL
    Conjugate
    Stronger by Science 28 free bench/squat/dead programs.
    5/3/1 for beginners.
    Westside for Skinny Bastards.
    PHAT and PHUL
    nSuns
}

show workout count in profile
Smolov says "Exercise: null, current 1rm: null"
follow all users
max editing (* = set manually, not in liftdom workout)(also measurements)

decimal percentage functionality
Improve the notification-bar layout.
Fix up the Exercise History Chart page. (maybe simply show exercises' full stuff (like 3x5@95lbs))
Add past update text to a dedicated page for that
=====================================================

============ BUG LIST =====================================================
==== easier ==========
bonus view gets misplaced. "Smolov Week 3 Day 2" on gabby's post...
============
==== harder ==========
re-check user made programs functionality (full)
(performance){
    (view holder) see if we need to change from multiple hidden views to one inserted view (use methods?)
    (recycler adapter) maybe do the operations currently in here in the assistor saved frag
}
Some algo concerns:
Main concern is about the days check. Doesn't seem to be any. It's working for now but that
    may be because hasRunThroughOnce is making sure we don't see the second copy.
    But what happens if we're on _Tuesday and we run through the other one first?
============

============ TO-DO FEATURE LIST =============================
better competitive stuff (login streaks, leaderboards, etc)
more monetization{
    look into the hiding of banner ads when switching frags to allow for multiple ads in same activity
    look at Zhuinden suggestion (setVisisbleHint? can't remember)
}
better old device support
frame publicity posts as looking for beta testers/early adopters
have the tutorials be made viewable by buttons
ask for good reviews, feedback if not good.

}

===== lifting/core-related =========
fix up the view of post info in completed workout view holder
alert user if their percentage goes above 100%
implement some sort of "short term memory" type thing for when changing weight options in template editor
try this for notification-bar/lockscreen view difference {
    https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/
    Notification.Builder.html#setPublicVersion(android.app.Notification)
}
need to make kgs have decimal capability
more percentage work{
    Will just be doing arbitrary weight now.
    Need to have possibility of choosing from maxes (which I also need to expand on)
}
make StatChartsFrag not look like shit (different colors for ex's, stack vertically)
WA update on set addition
use .setPublicVersion to show different lockscreen service view
add share option for finished workout
more quotes in more places
add better running support
redo add-exercise flow in WA (set set-scheme + superset)
add feedback page (or just create chat with each user)
more programs {
    PPL
    5x5
    Starting Strength
    Mad Cow
    Texas Method
}
fill in the Knowledge Center (including ex descriptions in other packages)
Advanced calendar view template editor a la Google Calendar (repeat every other, etc)
======================

===== social/user-related ==========
Add third tab to profile slider (Stats (active template, streak, maxes, etc))
Forum
fix overflow icon (currently is always search bar)
Empty search show all users
Discover tab // or community tab, show highest rated posts from everyone{
    instead, could just add a default checkbox that adds your workout to the public pool.
    the main feed then just has a slider that also shows the global community
}
glide caching in chat (maybe just do it differently, load in parent, get from parent)
chat unread stuff/rehaul (including badge/notifications/unread functionality(bool hasRead))
forum
======================
=====================================================

============ UNREPLICABLE/UNDECIDED =============================================
maybe just have one user profile? (could really utilize methods/delegating here)
sign in text is cut off (API 21 issue)
bottom nav text is cut off (API 21 issue)
=====================================================

============ FUTURE TO-DO LIST =====================================================
change search suggestions to current following (visibility issue?)
password recovery/changing
look into design stuff like font
// be a real companion. personalize the shit...
    // tell them about eating and sleeping and stretching, foam rolling,etc
    // give them options for push notifications and reminders
=====================================================

======== RANDOM STUFF I WROTE DOWN =================================================
"Important steps for scaled success"
-------------------------------------
Fix up the chat, big time.
Public posts tab (posted via public-checkmark in WA)
Take a good look at completion/log-in streak. Need compulsive opening of Liftdom...
Main feed performance/visual rehaul
Scaling of power level needs to be looked at. We need faster leveling at the low levels probably.
Share completed workouts to Facebook/Twitter/Raw copy
Target niche workout programs/subreddits with good sized followings.

Leaderboard tab in Assistor Saved (Global/Local)
CompletedWorkoutViewholder - if is the current day, display in minutes or hours ago.
