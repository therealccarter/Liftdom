Post rest days (public description too)
rep button
template editor is in kg, despite user being imperial.
figure out how to do release notes
changing to bodyweight shifts layout to the right...
make sure that metric is totally integrated
so, all there is is the creation of the template.
if the user is imperial, the template is imperial.
if the user is metric, the template is metric.
That's it.
From there, all we have to do is convert the template when viewed.
When saved, it converts to whatever imperial bool the user is, because it's been converted.
