Howdy fellas, could use a little input on what programs you wouldn't mind seeing in an Android app. I spent about two years on an app that allows for totally custom handmade workouts, but that just isn't working out for user growth. Seems I need to add premade programs or else I won't get users and so I'd like to get some input on what programs you'd like to see in an app.

You can create just about any workout in the app that's situated weekly but as for bespoke workout programs I need some suggestions. I've already added Smolov as a proof of concept and am going to probably add a basic p/p/l next. What else would you like to see? Thinking nsuns, starting strength maybe. Idk though. App's called Liftdom if anyone cares.

Much obliged if you could hit me with your favorite programs that could use an app hosting.

Stronger by Science 28 free bench/squat/dead programs. 5/3/1 for beginners. Westside for Skinny Bastards. PHAT and PHUL are pretty popular as well

Whatever you do don’t add 5/3/1 programs to it. Without having read Jim’s writing in the topic it’s very difficult to run them effectively

I'll keep that in mind. I've actually used a version of 5/3/1 myself in the past that I found on the internet, but I never read into it. Any suggestions on where to start with written material?

Beyond 5/3/1 and 5/3/1 Forever would be the two best ways to get a good understanding of Jim’s programming. The problem is getting people who are using your app to read the books too.

why is this ? The premise behind it seem so straight forward you read it. I don't get how so many people can F it up.

It’s a failure to understand the methodology. On paper it’s seems easy to understand. You have three weeks, they’re periodized and increase in intensity over time, you do AMRAPS on your last set etc. What’s not easy about that? But when you haven’t read the books people fail to add in Jumps and Throws. Don’t do Conditioning. Fail to add enough assitance work and effectively add sets after the main work.

All things that are very important to the success of the program. Basically it’s really easy to fuck up and not run it properly if you don’t understand the principles behind it. At least that’s my take on it.

What's your opinion on this as a beginner/basic version of 5/3/1 to add to my app? Specifically I liked this version because it does include the things you mentioned (jumps/throws/conditioning) which I can easily implement.

Adding 5/3/1 for beginners would be fine as it is not a template but an actual program.

Yeah I'm liking it so far. Pretty easy to program in as well.
