/*
How do we remember the assistance exercises?
How do we add the ex frags in knowing they're for assistance?
We need a boolean within them that we'll activate.
But then how do we remember that boolean when we head over to AS?
We have a callback that is triggered when you choose an exercise if that ex frag has
 the right boolean. It will add the exercise to premade info as the key and the value will
 be the weight. 0 at first. Then each time we update the node we look for ex frags with
 the boolean and whose ex name matches our keys. We then update the premade info with that
 key's new weight. Then in AS we just take those keys and add them to the template's pre
 made info. So then when we come through again, we will have those exercise's and their
 weights to fill in the dialog. Remember we'll also need the set scheme for
 Push/Pull/LegsCore. That should also be in premade info.

/**
 * We need to store the last used assistance for each assistance type.
 *
 * So each time we update the assistance and put it in premade info,
 * we'll store it also in a value lastUsedPush, lastUsedPull, lastUsedLegCore.
 * Only difficulty will be determining which it is. Should we compare it to a list each
 * time or should we send the type from ExNameWAFrag?
